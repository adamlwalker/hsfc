<h3>Dog Adoption Process</h3><p><img src="/system/comfy/cms/files/files/000/000/017/original/adopt_dog.jpg" alt="Adopt Dog" style="float: left; width: 239px; height: 239px; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px;" rel="float: left; width: 239px; height: 239px; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px;"></p><p>
	If you're looking for a companion and a new best friend here's what you can do to speed up the process to fulfill your dream.
</p><p>
	Click on applications and fill out the dog adoption application.
</p><p>
	When we receive your application we will review it and contact you as soon as possible. During this review we try to determine which of our dogs is a suitable match for your lifestyle and needs. Our hope is to place our dogs in a forever home with the best match possible.
</p><p>
	The next step is to come out and meet the dogs we think are a good match for you and your family. We have a private farm and an appointment must be made in advance. We will set a day and time that is convenient for you.
</p><p>
	When you come to our farm we hope you fall in love with one of our dogs. If you do, we will set up a time to do a home visit. Also, at this time, we will have you fill out our dog adoption contract and we will not continue to show this dog to others who might be interested.
</p><p>
	After the home visit is done we will set up a time to come back to the farm to finalize the adoption and you can take our new family member home.
</p><p>
	Please do not panic when we suggest a home visit. This is not to determine if you keep a spotless home, but a way for us to check your fencing, if applicable, see where the dog will stay when you are not at home, answer any questions you might have and it also gives you the opportunity to get ready for his arrival.
</p><p>
	We hope the adoption process is a pleasant experience for you and we will do our best to expedite the procedure as quickly as possible, so you can enjoy your new best friend.
</p><h3>Cat Adoption Process</h3><p><img src="/system/comfy/cms/files/files/000/000/018/original/adopt_cat.jpg" alt="" style="float: right; width: 266px; height: 266px; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px;" rel="float: right; width: 266px; height: 266px; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px;"></p><p>
	To see fostered cats you must attend one of the scheduled foster adoption events. When you are certain this is the animal you wish to adopt, complete an application at the event and submit to an HSFC representative. The HSFC will review the application information and will determine you are a suitable match for the selected pet.
</p><p>
	To see an HSFC Administration animal, visit the HSFC office in Fairfax to see your preferred cat. Complete an application and the office manager will take you to view cats that reside at the building. The office manager will thoroughly review your application upon its completion.
</p><p>
	We invest a tremendous amount of emotional support in each of our animals and are dedicated to finding them the best possible homes for their particular needs. When you adopt an animal from us, you must sign a legally binding contract stating that you will comply with full knowledge <strong>all</strong> of our policies.

All HSFC dogs, cats, and rabbits are spayed or neutered prior to adoption. The adoption fees for the animals in our care are minimal, especially compared to the unconditional love and companionship adoptees will receive in return!
